# npontu-customer-database
The Npontu Customer Database project is designed to streamline customer support and product improvement by creating a centralized database system for managing customer interactions, feedback, and product purchase data. Inspired by real-world challenges faced by Npontu Technologies, where fragmented data led to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for product updates, this solution enhances customer service, enables product teams to make data-driven decisions, and ensures a positive customer experience.
